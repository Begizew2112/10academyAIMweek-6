    "What is Credit Risk?\n",
    "Credit risk refers to the possibility that a borrower or a counterparty will fail to meet their obligations according to the agreed terms, such as defaulting on a loan or failing to repay credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Aspects of Credit Risk:\n",
    "Probability of Default (PD): This is a measure of the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan or debt obligation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Loss Given Default (LGD): If a borrower defaults, not all loans result in a 100% loss. LGD is the percentage of the loan that the lender will lose in case of a default. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exposure at Default (EAD): This is the total value the lender is exposed to at the time of default. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Loss (EL): The expected loss is the combination of PD, LGD, and EAD. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Loss = PD × LGD × EAD\n",

    "Protecting Against Financial Loss: The primary goal of credit risk management is to prevent financial losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Credit Scoring Models: Credit risk is often managed using credit scoring models, which assign a score or probability to a borrower’s likelihood of default. \n",
    "\n",
    "High credit score: Indicates low credit risk. \n",
    "Low credit score: Indicates high credit risk, meaning the borrower is more likely to default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining Loan Terms: Credit risk influences the terms of loans, including interest rates, collateral requirements, and loan approval. Borrowers with higher risk profiles might face higher interest rates or be required to provide more collateral to offset the increased risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factors That Influence Credit Risk:\n",
    "Borrower’s Credit History: A borrower's credit history is one of the most important factors used in determining their credit risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Income and Financial Stability: Lenders assess whether the borrower’s income is sufficient to cover the loan repayments. A borrower with a stable, high income is typically considered less risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debt-to-Income Ratio: This is the ratio of a borrower’s total debt to their income. A high debt-to-income ratio suggests that the borrower is heavily indebted and may struggle to meet new loan obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic Conditions: Broader economic factors, such as recession or inflation, can impact the likelihood of defaults. In times of economic downturn, more borrowers may default due to job losses or declining business revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collateral: Collateral is something of value that is pledged to secure the loan. If a borrower defaults, the lender can seize the collateral to recover some or all of the loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Credit Risk in the Context of Your Project:\n",
    "In your project, credit risk will be modeled using the data provided by the eCommerce platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer's transaction history (e.g., amounts, types of purchases).\n",
    "Fraud results (indicating any fraudulent activities associated with the customer).\n"

    "How Credit Scoring Models Work:\n",
    "Data Collection: The first step is collecting customer data that is relevant to predicting their likelihood of default. This could include their transaction history, purchasing habits, past repayment behavior, and demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Once data is collected, you need to identify which features (variables) are the most predictive of a borrower’s credit risk. Common features include transaction value, frequency of purchases, and past fraud involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling: With the selected features, you can build a credit scoring model using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting machines. The model is trained on historical data to learn the patterns that lead to defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring: Once the model is trained, it can be used to assign a score or classification (such as \"low risk\" or \"high risk\") to new customers based on their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision-Making: The credit score generated by the model helps in making informed decisions about whether to extend credit to a particular customer and under what conditions (e.g., interest rates or collateral requirements)."
